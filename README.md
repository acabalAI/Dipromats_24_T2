# AI Diplomacy Task 2 - Tweet Narrative Analysis

## Overview
This script is developed as part of Task 2 for the AI Diplomacy contest 2024, hosted at [Dipromats 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/dipromats2024/home). It is designed to analyze tweets to determine how different narratives related to geopolitical issues are portrayed on social media, with a focus on China, Russia, the EU, and the USA. The system employs a revolutionary multiagent, multisignal approach that significantly outperforms the baseline and all other competing models.

## Project Objectives
- **Narrative Detection:** Classify tweets into predefined categories to identify specific narratives related to the global diplomatic engagements of China, Russia, the EU, and the USA.
- **Data Export:** Process and export data in JSON and CSV formats to enable further analysis and reporting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure Python is installed, and prepare to install several dependencies required for the script to function:

1. **Python Installation**: Visit [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for installation instructions if Python is not already installed.
2. **Install Required Python Libraries**: Use the following command to install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash

## Additional Information

A comprehensive conference paper detailing the system is available in the repository at [Conference Paper](assets/documents/TFM_CaballeroHinojosaAlberto.pdf).
This paper provides further insights into the system's design, methodology, and performance metrics.
The system's revolutionary multiagent, multisignal approach sets a new standard in narrative detection and analysis, achieving superior performance compared to the baseline and other competing models. For detailed performance metrics and comparison, refer to the conference paper.
